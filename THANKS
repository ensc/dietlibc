I initially took some syscalls from Redhat minilibc, but the code has
been completely replaced now.

I initially took localtime and the directory reading routines from
uClibc, but the code has been completely replaced now.

The malloc code was done by Olaf Dreesen, who also helped with the SPARC
start code and fork().  Olaf also did the printf and scanf routines and
he is currently implementing pthreads (wow!).

syslog and crypt were contributed by René Müller.

Jeff Garzik contributed {get,set}{pw,gr,sp}ent.

I also grabbed code from glibc (mostly assembly routines).
